Distributed Key-Value Storage written in Rust.

## Project Outlines

The project outlines as described in my blog post about [Open Source Software Collaboration](https://blog.fox21.at/2019/02/21/open-source-software-collaboration.html).

- The main purpose of this software is to provide a cluster of servers, which all store the same data as key-value.
- This list is open. Feel free to request features.
